# EDITED-woocommerce-auto-added-coupons
I edited plugin(https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-auto-added-coupons/screenshots/) for some more functionality.
Using my plugin you can restrict group of users to use a coupon.
You should have following plugin preinstalled to use this plugin:
    Groups-- https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/
    Woocommerce-- https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/
    WP add bulk users in group-- https://github.com/rajuknit/wp-add-bulk-users-in-group
